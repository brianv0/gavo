Thoughts on Things to be Rewritten
==================================

Misc
----

In valuemappers: let them return db types rather than votable types.

Have units always be unitconv-parseable, move things like "h m s" and
such to displayHints.

Add parsespecials to structs and attributes to have a clean way to
declare things like nostrip and original, ref, etc.
