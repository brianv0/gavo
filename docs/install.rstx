These installation instructions cover the installation of the complete
data center suite.  Installing libraries or, say, the tapsh, is much
less involved.  See the respective pages at the `GAVO DC's software
distribution pages`_ for details on those.

.. _GAVO DC's software distribution pages: http://vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/soft


Debian systems
==============

The preferred way to run DaCHS is on Debian stable or compatible
systems.   To install, `add our APT repository`_ to your
`/etc/apt/sources.list` and install the `gavodachs-server` package, e.g. by
running::

  sudo apt-get install gavodachs-server

With that, you're ready to proceed to the tutorial_ and the `Operator's
Guide`_

If you plan to publish SIAP services ("images"), you will probably want
to manually compile the preview scaler as described below.  If you find
yourself doing this, please complain to the authors – there's been code
that should make all this superfluous in DaCHS for quite a time now and
we've still not done it.  Sorry.

Installation without Package Management
=======================================

Dependencies
------------

Unfortunately, DaCHS has quite a few dependencies;
here's the list of dependencies of our Debian package as of version
0.8.4; this should give you some clue as to what might be necessary on
other systems::

  adduser, members, postgresql-8.4-pgsphere |
  postgresql-9.0-pgsphere | postgresql-9.1-pgsphere, postgresql-8.4-q3c |
  postgresql-9.0-q3c | postgresql-9.1-q3c, python, python-imaging,
  python-nevow, python-numpy, python-pkg-resources, python-psycopg2,
  python-pyfits, python-soappy, python-twisted,
  python-zsi, python-setuptools, python-all, python-lxml,
  python-docutils, python-pywcs, python-matplotplib

If you want to use boosters, you will additionally need::

  build-essential libcfitsio3-dev 

Of course, you'll need postgres itself on top of that.  We currently
require postgres 9.0 or newer.  If you actually need support for older
Postgres releases, let us know – it's not  hard to restore.


PgSphere
''''''''

PgSphere is a postgres extension for spherical geometry.  It is needed
for support of the geometric types in DaCHS' ADQL implementation and in
the preferred SIAP backend, so you should definitely install it.  Obtain
the source from http://pgsphere.projects.postgresql.org/, and in the
source directory run::

  USE_PGXS=1 make
  sudo USE_PGXS=1 make install


Q3C
'''

DaCHS uses the Q3C library by Sergey Koposov et al,
http://www.sai.msu.su/~megera/oddmuse/index.cgi/SkyPixelization for
positional indexes.  DaCHS uses it for positional indexes (the
scs#q3cindex mixin) and in the interpretation of ADQL.  It is therefore
highly recommended to install it.

To do that, get the source from the web site given above or directly
from http://code.google.com/p/q3c/, and in the source directory run::

  make
  sudo make install




Installing without a package manager
------------------------------------


Getting the source
''''''''''''''''''

If you cannot use the Debian package (or do not want to), you can grab
a gavodachs package from `our distribution page`_.  Choose whatever
`gavodachs-latest.tar.gz` points to.

If you want to follow the bleeding edge closely – DaCHS is being
actively developed – check out whatever is in the subversion repository
right now.  For a read-only copy, say::

  svn co http://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/gavo/python/trunk/ dachs

After that, the current source code is in the ``dachs`` subdirectory.
This is development code, so *please* do not hesitate to contact us if
something weird is going on with it.  We mean it; even trivial reports
help us to gauge where our software behaves contrary to expectations.
Plus, we don't have oodles of users, so chances are you won't
get on our nerves.  For contact options see 
http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/#support.

.. _our distribution page: http://vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/soft/dist


Installing from source
''''''''''''''''''''''

The DaCHS installer is based on setuptools; we do not use setuptools'
dependency management, though, since in practice it seems more trouble
than it's worth, which means you need to manually install Dependencies_.

To install the software, in the ``dachs`` directory you checked out
above, say::

  sudo python setup.py develop

(there are various options to get the stuff installed when you prefer 
not to install as root; refer to the `setuptools documentation`_ if 
necessary).  The checkout itself needs to be readable by whoever later
runs the server in this mode.  You can also use ``install`` instead of
``develop``; in that case, you will have to rerun setup.py everytime
you update the source.

Setup
=====

All this is taken care of by the Debian package, so don't do any of this
if you installed from .deb.


Introduction
------------

GAVO DaCHS is quite sensitive to a correct setup as regards permissions.
Experience has shown that user setup is the number one reason for
installation problems.  So, up front, here's what the steps given
below should create:

* A group  that will own certain directories that must be writable by 
  the server (by default gavo).
* A user  that the server will run as (by default gavo).
* A unix account for you that should not be root (in particular not if
  you're using setup.py develop on an SVN checkout).  This should be in
  the gavo group (for when you're running ``gavo serve debug``) and will
  usually own resource directories and the like.

On the database side, the following must be ascertained:

* There's a postgres database cluster in the C locale, with a database
  already created (named, by default gavo).
* "you" (i.e., your unix id) have admin privileges on this (at least
  for installation) using ident authentication
* for connections from the local host, the three roles the server use
  can access the database using md5 authentication.


Account Management
------------------

You should first create a user that the DaCHS server runs as later,
and a group for running DC-related processes in::

  sudo adduser --system gavo
  sudo addgroup --system gavo
  sudo adduser gavo gavo

(or similar, depending on your environment). This user should not be
able to log in, but it should have a home directory.  Everyone that may
issue a ``gavo serve debug`` must be in the group created (this is
because the log directory will be writable by this group); in
particular, you should add yourself::

  sudo adduser `id -nu` gavo

You may want to create another account for "maintenance", or just use
your normal account; if more than one person will feed the data center,
you'll need more elaborate schemes.

To update the system's idea of your group membership, say ``newgrp
gavo`` or log in and out now.

All users that are to ingest data into the database using DaCHS must be
part of this gavo group.


Database setup
--------------

The most complicated step in setting up DaCHS is actually setting up the
database.  We currently only support postgres.

While it is conceivable to use DaCHS together with an existing postgres
database, we do not recommend trying this the first time.  Experiment
with a database dedicated to DaCHS first, then consider whether it's
worth interfacing to your existing database or whether a copy of that
data is more convenient.


Cluster Creation
''''''''''''''''

You first need a database to play with, preferably in a suitable
cluster (you could skip this, but the all bets are off as to whether
you'll be able to store non-ASCII characters in strings).  

It is recommended to create a dedicated cluster first even if you want
to connect DaCHS to a pre-existing database later to get a feel for how
it works.  See `Connecting to a remote database`_ for information on
what setup is necessary in this case.

Database cluster generator is very system-dependent, and ideally a
database admin would assist you.  

On Debian systems dedicated for GAVO DaCHS, you can try the following:

(#) Find out the version of the server you will be running (e.g., using
    ``dpkg -l``; in Debian, more than one version may be installed in
    parallel.  It's probably a good idea to use the most recent one.
    Set your desired version for subsequent use::

      export PGVERSION=9.1

(#) Drop the Debian default cluster (this will delete everything in
    there -- for a fresh install, that doesn't matter, but don't do this
    if other people use the database).  If you don't do this, your
    database will listen do a different port, and you will have to
    adapt the default profiles::

      sudo pg_dropcluster --stop $PGVERSION main

(#) Create the new cluster used by DaCHS::

      sudo pg_createcluster -d /<path-to-where-your-db-should-reside> \
        --locale=C -e UNICODE\
        --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C $PGVERSION pgdata

    The locale should currently be C, because only the C locale will
    allow you databases with all kinds of encodings.  The database
    stores descriptions and similar entities, and you may encounter
    funny characters in there.  It would be a shame if you couldn't
    store them (plus, you would get odd error messages for those).

(#) Start the server::
    
       sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start

(#) Create the database itself::

       sudo -u postgres createdb --encoding=UTF-8 gavo  

On Debian, the configuration files for this cluster are at
``/etc/postgresql/$PGVERSION/pgdata/``.



Initial Account Setup
'''''''''''''''''''''

At least during setup, you also need superuser privileges on the
database.  For ``gavo init`` below to work, your normal account must
have such privileges.  On Debian systems, you can simply say::

  sudo -u postgres createuser -s `id -nu`

You can drop those privileges later if they make you nervous, but for
gavo init you need to be DB superuser.  Also note that DaCHS assumes
your server is trusted, and if people have managed to take over an
account in the gavo group, they can do with your database whatever they
please anyway.  In particular (don't complain we didn't tell you), DaCHS
currently encrypts *no* passwords; for the DB passwords, sensible
encryption would mean the software requires some passphrase during
startup, which we don't want.  For user passwords (for protecting web
resources), it would make no sense since with HTTP basic authentication
as employed by DaCHS, they travel through the net unencrypted anyway
(which is sometimes called "mild security").


Connecting to a Remote Database
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

If you already have a database and are fed up with playing around in the
toy database we advised you to start with at the top of `Cluster
Creation`_, you still need to prepare the database server.  You
may need to edit pg_hba.conf on the remote side as discussed in
`adapting pg_hba.conf`_ to allow password authenticated access from the
host that runs DaCHS.  And, during initialization, you will need access
to a superuser profile, in the following, admin::

  gavo init -d "host=foo.bar user=admin password=secret"


Adapting pg_hba.conf
''''''''''''''''''''

The default DaCHS configuration speaks to the server via TCP/IP.  Unless
you give an option during gavo init below, it will try to connect to the
server on 127.0.0.1.  This will work fairly well, but depending on usage
details, you may gain some (or even quite a lot) performance if you let
DaCHS talk to postgres via unix domain sockets (that, of course, only
works if DaCHS and postgres are on the same server).  To do that, you
must fix your ``pg_hba.conf``.  This is tricky, and we recommend you
make your system run first and then try what's described here if you
think you must.

On Debian systems, the ``pg_hba.conf`` is in
``/etc/postgresql/<version>/<cluster>/``, e.g.
``/etc/postgresql/9.2/pgdata/`` if you created a new cluster by the
abover recipe with postgres 9.2, or ``/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/`` in a
default Debian cluster with postgres 8.4.  Other systems may have it in
whacky places.

Note that running a database server always is a security liability.  You
should make sure you understand what the pg_hba.conf (in postgres'
configuration directory) says.  

To let DaCHS access postgres via unix domain sockets, you must have a
line like::

  local   gavo        gavo,gavoadmin,untrusted          md5

in pg_hba.conf, probably right below the line allowing the postgres user
complete access (the order of lines in pg_hba.conf is significant); it
allows password authentication for the three users above from the local
machine.  To make the server use the new local connection, comment out
the line for ``host`` in your ``rootDir/etc/dsn`` file (with a hash).

You must restart the postgres server after you changed pg_hba.conf to
make the server notice your changes.


Configuration File
------------------

Next, you need to decide on a "root" directory for DaCHS.  Below it,
there are data descriptions, cache files, logs, etc. (these locations
can be changed later, but for a simple setup we recommend keeping
everything together).  By default, this is ``/var/gavo``.

DaCHS is configured in an INI-style configuration file in
``/etc/gavo.rc`` (overridable using the envirvonment variable
``GAVOSETTINGS``).  In addition, users, in particular the gavo user, can
have ~/.gavorc files, the contents of which override settings in
/etc/gavo.rc.

`Configuration Settings <./opguide.html#configuration-settings>`_ 
gives a walkthrough through the most important
settings; for now, you must set the DaCHS root dir if you are not happy
with ``/var/gavo``::

  [general]
  rootDir: /data/gavo

as /etc/gavo.rc.

You can now let DaCHS create its file system hierarchy::

  gavo init

For this to work, ``rootDir`` must exist and be writable by you, or you
must have sufficient privileges to create it.  Do *not* run ``gavo
init`` as root, since the files and directories it creates will be owned
by whoever ran the program.  In the typical situation in which you may
not write to ``rootDir``'s parent, do something like::

  sudo mkdir -p /data/gavo
  sudo chown `id -nu`:gavo /data/gavo

``gavo init`` may spit out a warning or two on the first run.  On repeated runs
no output at all should appear.

If your database server is not on the same machine as your web server
(which is not recommended for a test setup), you have to pass a complete
DSN that lets DaCHS connect as a superuser to ``gavo init``.  A DSN
("Data Source Name") is a sequence of key-values pairs as used  by ODBC
or Postgres itself (with keys discussed in `Database Connection Control
Functions in the postgres documentation`_).  You would say something
like::

  gavo init --dsn "host=myhost.xy port=5546 user=super password=secret dbname=wisdom"

– make sure you give at least dbname and whatever role DaCHS ends up
using has superuser privileges during setup (that role is not used
during normal DaCHS operation any more).

You can later run gavo init again. It will not clobber anything you did
in the meantime (well, if it does, it's a bug and you should fiercely
complain).  In particular, this is the most convenient way to create
directories if you changed locations in ``gavo.rc``.

.. _Database Connection Control Functions in the postgres documentation: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html


Binaries
========

If you want to provide previews for images, you must compile some
binaries.  these are in the ``src`` subdirectory of the source tree.
Just enter all subdirectories there in turn and say ``make install`` in
each.  Run these as yourself (i.e., as datacenter administrator), not as
root.  [If you're looking for a nice project to contribute, replacing
those with python equivalents would be welcome and doesn't take
much knowledge of DaCHS' internals.  products.ScaledFITSProduct shows
how this could work for the FITS case, and jpegpreview should
probably be done by PIL in-memory]


Specifying meta information fallbacks
=====================================

In the file ``$GAVO_ROOT/etc/defaultmeta.txt`` you should give some
information filled in when the resources do not give this kind of
metadata themselves.  Don't sweat it for now, but you must fix it before
you run your own registry.


The init script
===============

Though you can operate the server manually through ``gavo serve
(start|stop|reload)``, you will probably want to install an init script
to ``/etc/init.d`` (or your system's equivalent place).  More
information on this is in `Starting and Stopping the Server in the 
operator's guide`_

.. _Starting and Stopping the Server in the operator's guide: opguide.html#starting-and-stopping-the-server


This concludes the installation instructions for the normal case.  Only
read on if you're curious and/or courageous.


Manual Database Preparation
===========================

Normally, the following steps are done by ``gavo init``.  So, on a
normal install you can stop reading here.

However, if you want to play tricks (e.g., remote database server), the
following instructions should help.


Creating database users
-----------------------

The data center software accesses the database in various functions.
These are mapped to profiles which correspond to access information
(basically, the DSN, user, and password).  There are three of them:

* feed -- the "admin" profile, used for feeding tables into the normal
  database, for user management, credentials checking and the like.
* trustedquery -- this profile is used for queries generated  by the DC
  software (though usually on behalf of a user).  The corresponding DB
  role can access all "normal" tables, privilege management is supposed
  to happen throught the web interface.
* untrustedquery -- the profile used for user-contributed SQL.  Only
  tables expressly opened up are accessible to it.

You can adapt those names as necessary in the corresponding profiles.
See the section on profiles in the `Operator's Guide <opguide.html>`_
for details.

The following procedure sets up users and databases as expected by the
default profiles (if you made yourself a superuser account as described
above you do not need the ``sudo -u postgres`` in these commands)::

  # create the database that'll hold your data
  sudo -u postgres createdb --encoding=UTF-8 gavo  
  # create the user that feeds the db...
  sudo -u postgres createuser -P -ADsr gavoadmin
  # and a user that usually has no write privileges
  sudo -u postgres createuser -P -ADSR gavo
  # and a user for ADQL queries (i.e., untrusted queries from the net)
  sudo -u postgres createuser -P -ADSR untrusted

Enter the passwords you assign here into the ``feed``, ``trustedquery``,
and ``untrustedquery`` profiles, respectively.  These profiles are found
in ``rootDir/etc``.

Finally, you need to let the various roles you just created access the 
database; you do this using the command line interface to postgres::

  sudo -u postgres psql gavo \
    -c "GRANT ALL ON DATABASE gavo TO gavoadmin"

For the individual tables, rights to gavo and untrusted are granted by
``gavo imp``, so you do not need to specify any rights for them.


Owner-only DB setup
-------------------

There is some setup that the database owner or at least a superuser must
do.  Right now, that is allowing stored procedures in Postgres' own
procedural language::

  psql gavo <<EOF
  CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql
  EOF


Reading the extensions' SQL files
---------------------------------

Both pgsphere and q3c have files that define SQL functions and such.
You'll have to manually read them into your new database.  You can find
these SQL files in the source directories of the packages, or in your
server's contrib directory.  On Debian systems, these contribution
directories are in ``/usr/share/postgresql/<VERSION>/contrib``.

So, on postgres 8.4 you could say::

  SRCDIR=/usr/share/postgresql/8.4/contrib
  psql gavo < $SRCDIR/q3c.sql
  psql gavo < $SRCDIR/pg_sphere.sql


Importing basic resources
-------------------------

There are some built-in tables in DaCHS, related to metadata storage,
certain protocols, and the like.  You must import them before the DC
software can be used.  This also is a nice test that at least some
things work.

So, in this sequence, run::

  gavo imp --system //dc_tables
  gavo imp --system //services
  gavo imp --system //users
  gavo imp --system //adql
  gavo imp --system //tap
  gavo imp --system //products
  gavo imp --system //obscore

Output of the type ``Columns affected: 0`` is ok for these commands.

The double slash in the identifiers above means "use system
resources".  All these really refer to resource descriptors (RD) in the
__system__ resource directory; at this point, they are the RDs shipped
with DaCHS.

If you get error messages, add a ``--hints`` after the gavo command,
like this::

  gavo --hints imp --system //dc_tables
  
This will (for the ``gavo`` command in general) give additional error
info where available.

You should now be able to run the examples in the tutorial.
