.SH SYNOPSIS
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
dachs [global\-options] <subcommand> [options] function\-argument ...
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
dachs  provides  support for data ingestion and publishing, for metadata
handling, and for a variety of VO protocols and standards, e.g. the
Table Access Protocol (TAP) or the Simple Cone Search (SCS).
.sp
There are numerous sub\-commands covering the various tasks (importing,
controlling the server, running tests, etc).
.sp
Subcommand names can be abbreviated to the shortest unique prefix.
.sp
A centeral concept of DaCHS is the Resource Descriptor (RD), and XML
description of a data collection including metadata, ingestion rules,
service definitions, and regression tests.  They are usually referenced
through their RD ids, which are the relative paths from DaCHS\(aq inputs
directory to the file containing the RD, with the conventional extension
\fB\&.rd\fP stripped.  For instance, in a default install, the file
\fB/var/gavo/inputs/myrsc/q.rd\fP would have \fBmyrsc/q\fP as RD id.
.sp
Most commands dealing with RD ids will also pick up RDs if referenced by
path; in the example above, if you are in \fB/var/gavo/inputs/myrsc\fP,
you could also reference the RD as either \fBq\fP or \fBq.rd\fP\&.
.sp
Several commands take references to RD elements (table definitions, exec
items, direct grammar, etc).  These consist of an RD id as just
discussed, a hash mark, and the XML id of the target element.  Tables
have an id automatically, for other elements you may have to add an
artificial id.
.SH GLOBAL OPTIONS
.sp
Global options are given before the subcommand name.

dachs admin  [\-h] subsubfunction [subfunction\-arguments ...]
.ft P

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is a somewhat random collection of commands related to
administering a data center.  In particular, this is where you create
and edit accounts.
.sp
subsubcommands can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is
unique.  For instance \fBgavo adm xsd\fP will do an XSD validation.
.sp
For more information on the subsubfunctions, pass a \fB\-h\fP flag.
.SS Subsubcommands
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaddtogroup user group\fP \-\- adds a user to a group
.IP \(bu 2
\fBadduser user password [remarks]\fP \-\- add  a  user/password pair to
the DaCHS user table.  Note that as of DaCHS 1.0 the password is stored
in clear text and also transmitted in clear text since DaCHS only
supports HTTP basic authentication.  Do not use valuable passwords
here
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdelfromgroup user group\fP \-\- remove a user from a group
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdeluser user\fP \-\- remove a DaCHS user from the user table.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlistusers\fP \-\- dump the user table
.IP \(bu 2
\fBchangeuser user password [remarks]\fP \-\- change remarks and/or
password for a DC user.  See adduser for details.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBcleantap\fP \-\- remove expired Universal Worker Service (UWS) jobs
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtapabort jobId helpMsg\fP \-\- manually abort a TAP job and return
helpMsg to the requesting user as error message.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBupdateTAPSchema\fP \-\- Update the TAP_SCHEMA metadata for all RDs
mentioned in TAP_SCHEMA.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdeclaredel\fP \-\- declare  an identifier as deleted (for when you\(aqve
removed the RD but the identifier still floats  on some registries.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBindexStatements tableRef\fP \-\- show the statements to create the
indices on a table.  The tableRef has the format RD\-id#table\-id; it
is \fInot\fP a database table reference.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBdumpDF path\fP \-\- Dumps the source of a file included with the DaCHS
distribution.  The argument is a package resource path.
(like /inputs/__system__/scs.rd); for system RDs, the special
//rd\-id syntax is supported.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBexecute execId\fP \-\- Execute the contents of an RD execute element. You
must give that element an explicit id in order to make this work; then
execId is rd\-id#exec\-id
.IP \(bu 2
\fBxsdValidate path\fP \-\- Validate a file against built\-in VO schemas
and with built\-in schema validator.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBsuggestucds tableId\fP \-\- Make suggestions for UCDs of the columns
of the referenced table (rd\-id#table\-id format) not having one.
This is based on their descriptions and uses a GAVO web service.
.UNINDENT
.SH THE CONFIG SUBCOMMAND
.sp
Synopsis:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dachs config [section\-name] config\-key
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This outputs values of DaCHS\(aq configuration to stdout.  section\-name
defaults to general.  This is most commonly used to make external
components aware of DaCHS\(aq file locations, e.g., through
\fBinputs_dir=$(dachs config inputsDir)\fP\&.
.sp
See the operator\(aqs guide for a documentation on DaCHS\(aq configuration
options.
.SH THE DROP SUBCOMMAND
.sp
Synopsis:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
drop [\-h] [\-s] [\-\-all] rd\-id [dd\-id ...]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the reverse of import: Tables created by a \fBdachs imp\fP with
identical arguments are being torn down by \fBdachs drop\fP\&.  This will
not work reliably if the RD has been modified between the imp and the
drop, in particular if the RD has been deleted.  In such situations, you
can use the \fB\-f\fP flag, which unconditionally tears down everything
DaCHS has recorded as coming from the referenced RD.
.SS Arguments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B rd\-id
RD path or ID to drop
.TP
.B dd\-id
optional  data descriptor (DD) ID(s) if you do not
want to drop the entire RD; note that  no  service
publications will be undone if you give DD IDs
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-all
drop  all  DDs  in  the RD, not only the auto ones
(overrides manual selection)
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-system
drop tables even if they are system tables
.UNINDENT
.SH THE IMPORT SUBCOMMAND
.sp
Synopsis:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
import [option] rd\-name [data\-id]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This subcommand is used to ingest data described by an RD.  For special
applications, ingestion can be restricted to specific data items within
an RD.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help
show this help message and exit
.TP
.B \-n\fP,\fB  \-\-updateRows
Deprecated.  Use updating data items instead.
.TP
.B \-d\fP,\fB  \-\-dumpRows
Dump raw rows as they are emitted by the grammar.
.TP
.B \-D\fP,\fB  \-\-dumpIngestees
Dump processed rows as emitted by the row makers.
.TP
.B \-R\fP,\fB  \-\-redoIndex
Drop indices before updating a table and recreate them
when done
.TP
.B \-m\fP,\fB  \-\-meta\-only
just update table meta (privileges, column
descriptions,...).
.TP
.B \-I\fP,\fB  \-\-meta\-and\-index
do not import, but update table meta (privileges,
column descriptions,...) and recreate the indices
.TP
.B \-u\fP,\fB  \-\-update
update mode \-\- don\(aqt drop tables before writing.
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-system
(re\-)create system tables, too
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
talk a lot while working
.TP
.B \-r\fP,\fB  \-\-reckless
Do not validate rows before ingestion

Stop after having parsed MAX rows
.TP
.BI \-b \ N\fP,\fB \ \-\-batch\-size\fB= N

.TP
.B \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-continue\-bad
do not bail out after an error, just skip the current
source and continue with the next one.
.TP
.B \-L\fP,\fB  \-\-commit\-after\-meta
commit the importing transaction after updating the
meta tables.  Use this when loading large (hence \-L)
data sets to avoid keeping a lock on the meta tables
for the duration of the input, i.e., potentially days.
The price is that users will see empty tables during
the import.
.UNINDENT
.SH THE INFO SUBCOMMAND
.sp
Synopsis:

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This initialises DaCHS\(aq file system and database environment.  Calling
\fBdachs init\fP on an existing site should not damage anything.  It

given; if you followed the  installation  instruc‐
tions, you do not need this option

inhibit  initialization  of  the database (you may
want to use this when refreshing the  file  system
hierarchy)

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This marks data and/or services contained in an RD as published; this

registry through DaCHS\(aq OAI\-PMH endpoint.  See the \fIOperator\(aqs Guide\fP
for details.
.SS Options

.TP

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will delete tables in the database and also remove their metadata
from DaCHS\(aq internal tables (e.g., TAP_SCHEMA, table of published
records).  Use this if \fBgavo drop\fP fails for to remove some table for
one reason or another.
.SS Argument
