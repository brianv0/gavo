So, a simple query could look like this::

  job = votable.ADQLTAPJob(accessURL, query)
  job.run()
  dataIterator, metadata = votable.load(job.openResult())
  data = list(dataIterator)

Metadata contains PARAMs, etc, but most importantly the field
definitions; you get them by simply iterating over the metadata.  
With continuing the example above, you could say::

  labels = [field.name for field in metadata]
  print [dict(zip(labels, row)) for row in data]
