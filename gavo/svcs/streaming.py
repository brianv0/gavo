	It is basically a pull producer.  To use it, construct it with
	a data source and a twisted request (or any IFinishableConsumer)
	If in a nevow resource, you should then return request.deferred.

	The data source simply is a function writeStreamTo taking one
	argument; this will be the DataStreamer.  You can call its write
	method to deliver data.  There's no need to close anything, just
	let your function return.

	writeStream will be run in a thread to avoid blocking the reactor.
	This thread will be halted if the consumer calls stopProducing.  Since
	python threads cannot be halted from outside, this works by the
	consumer's thread acquiring the writeLock and only releasing it
	on resumeProducing.
