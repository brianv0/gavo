"""
Adding field infos to columns and other objects in an ADQL parse tree.

When we want to generate VOTables from ADQL queries, we must know types,
units, ucds, and the like, and we need to know STC information for
all columns in a query.

To to that, we traverse the parse tree postorder looking for nodes that have
an addFieldInfos method (note the plural).  These then get called,
which causes one of the classes in adql.fieldinfos to be constructed
and assigned to the node's fieldInfos attribute.  The source for
these infos is either an AnnotationContext (and thus typically
the user-supplied retrieveFieldInfos function) or derived annotations.
These are computed by the nodes themselves, using their addFieldInfo 
(singular!) method.
