The schemata that we might want to validate against.  They are mainly
here for unit tests.

If you add schema files, run makeValidator.py to build a new validator for the
unit tests.  It will move its ouput file (xsdval.class) to the unit test
directory automatically.

Do check for external references in the the schemata, though.  The goal
is to let validators run requesting only files from vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de

To make that work, do this after changes:

./install.sh
