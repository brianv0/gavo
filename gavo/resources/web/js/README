DaCHS-related javascript; the general policy is that we blindly pull 
javascript blobs from upstream.  This, admittedly, stinks, and we may
want to change that at some point.

Anyway, here's where the stuff comes from:

samp.js -- https://github.com/astrojs/sampjs.git, last updated 2012-12
jquery-gavo.js -- jquery.com, this is a minified jquery with the ui plugin,
  last updated 2011-09
jquery.flog.js -- http://www.flotcharts.org/, last updated 2011-11



JS that didn't come minified (samp.js, currently) was minified using *cough*
google's online "closure compiler"; I've operated it using curl, like so:

curl -dcompilation_level=SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS -doutput_format=text \
	-doutput_info=compiled_code \
	--data-urlencode js_code@../../../../../src/sampjs/samp.js \
	http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/compile


I guess I should be minifying gavo.js at some point...
