DaCHS-related javascript; there's a chapter on this in develNotes.rstx

Here's when we last pulled the stuff (source URLs are in develNotes)

samp.js -- 2015-01
jquery-gavo.js -- 2015-01
jquery.flot.js -- 2015-01

In its default configuration, DaCHS minifies this code before sending it to the browsers.  That's inconvenient for debugging the stuff, and hence you can
turn it off by setting [web]minifyJS to False in /etc/gavo.rc.
