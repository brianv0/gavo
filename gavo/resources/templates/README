In addition to the HTML template for DaCHS' web interface, this
directory also contains the template for the reference documentation;
since it is used by gavo gendoc, it needs to be in the distributed
resources.

Do *not* edit refdoc.rstx here.  It is maintained in DaCHS' documentation
repo, https://github.com/chbrandt/dachs-doc.git.  In a checkout of that,
have something like the following in
.git/hooks/post-merge and
.git/hooks/post-commit:

#!/bin/sh
# this hook updates the reference doc template in the GAVO source distribution
# and should be both post-merge and post-commit
cp docs/source/refdoc.rstx ../trunk/gavo/resources/templates/refdoc.rstx

(fix the relative path, of course.
