This is an infrastructure for parsing plain text sources into a database
and possibly into VOTables.  It is used by gavoimp.

The basic structure is:  A grammar (e.g. CFGrammar) produces a dictionary
mapping rather arbitrary keys to values.  These dictionaries are shipped
to the grammar's row processor, which already resides in the semantics.

The semantics have field definitions and thus knows about, e.g., types and
ucds.  Based on that information, it builds a dictionary mapping data
bases names to values appropriate for inserting into a database.  The
semantics can also be queried for the table structure, which is used
during SQL import.  All that is collected within a DataSet (which 
corresponds to one table).
