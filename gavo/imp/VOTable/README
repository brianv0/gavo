PyVOTable
A Python toolkit for parsing and writing VOTable documents.
Author: F. Pierfederici <fpierfed@eso.org>

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.0 (see LICENSE.txt). 

VERSION: 1.0a1 (alpha) Oct. 1, 2005



Requirements
 * Python 2.2 or later (http://www.python.org).


Installation
PyVOTable uses the standard Python distutils module. To install, simply unpack
the distribution tarball, change to the distribution directory and invoke the
setup.py script:
	% tar zxf pyvotable.tar.gz
	% cd pyvotable
	% python setup.py install


Usage
PyVOTable implements a single Python module called VOTable. The module exposes
tow classes: Parser and Writer. They can be used as in the following examples:

	>>> from VOTable import Parser
	>>> votable = Parser(fileName).votable
	>>> for res in votable.resources:
    >>>     for tab in res.tables:
    >>>         for field in tab.fields:
    >>>             print(field.data)


A convenience function called parser is available as well. To use it, simply
modify your code to read 

	>>> from VOTable import parse
	>>> votable = parse(fileName)

instead of
	
	>>> from VOTable import Parser
	>>> votable = Parser(fileName).votable



Limitations
Write operations are not supported yet. The code is, therefore, not feature 
complete. This is the reason for the alpha designation. Despite being at alpha
stage, the parsing code is very stable and pretty fast, especially for VOTable
documents of up to a few megabytes in size.

As stated in the LICENSE.txt file (Academic Free License version 2.0), 
PyVOTable is distributed as is and it is not officially supported. However 
users are encouraged to send feedback and bug reports to <fpierfed@eso.org>.
