	PDS is the file format of the Planetary Data System; the labels
	are quite like, but not quite like FITS headers.

	Extra care needs to be taken here since the values in the rawdicts
	can be complex objects (e.g., other labels).  It's likely that you
	will need constructs like ``@IMAGE["KEY"]``.

	Current versions of PyPDS also don't parse the values.  This is
	particularly insiduous because general strings are marked with " in PDS.
	When mapping those, you'll probably want a @KEY.strip('"').

	You'll need PyPDS to use this; there's no Debian package for that yet,
	so you'll have to do a source install from
	git://github.com/RyanBalfanz/PyPDS.git
