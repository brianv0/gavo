"""
General event handling.

Basically, everything roughly classified as user interaction should go
through this module.  gavo.base, on import, creates an instance of 
EventDispatcher and installs it as base.ui.  The rest of the library
can then call methods of base.ui.

Clients can then register observers (probably derived from
base.observer.Observer) that subscribe to events and can display or 
log them in some form appropriate to the client.
