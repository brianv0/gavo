"""
A cron-like facility to regularly run some functions.

Most of the apparatus in here is not really for user consumption.
There's a singleton of the queue created below, and the methods of that
singleton are exposed as module-level functions.

To make the jobs actually execute, the running program has to call 
registerSchedulerFunction(schedulerFunction).  Only the first 
registration is relevant.  The schedulerFunction has the signature 
sf(delay, callable) and has to arrange for callable to be called delay 
seconds in the future; twisted's reactor.callLater works like this.

However, you should arrange for previous callLaters to be canceled when 
a new one comes in.  There is no management to make sure only one
queue reaper runs at any time (it doesn't hurt much if more than one
run, but it's a waste of resources).
