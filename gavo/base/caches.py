"""
Accessor functions for the various immutables we have.

The main purpose of this module is to keep caches of resource descriptors,
and other items the parsing of which may take some time.

All you need to do is provide a function taking a "key" (a string, most
likely) and returning the object.  Then call

base.caches.makeCache(<accessorName>, <function>)

After that, clients can call

base.caches.<accessorName>(key)

You can additionally provide an isDirty(res) function when calling makeCache.
This can return True if the resource is out of date and should be reloaded.

An alternative interface to registering caches is the registerCache function
(see there).
