	A Resource does nothing; it is for registration of Authorities,

	carry their own metadata and care for their registration themselves.).

	All resources must either have an id (which is used in the construction of
	their IVOID), or you must give an identifier meta item.
	
	You must further set the following meta items:

	   - resType specifying the kind of resource record.  You should not
	     use this element to build resource records for services or tables
	     (use the normal elements, even if the actual resrouces are external
	     to DaCHS).  resType can be registry, organization, authority, 
	     deleted, or anything else for which registry.builders has a
	     handling class.
	   - title
	   - subject(s)
	   - description
	   - referenceURL
	   - creationDate
	
	Additional meta keys (e.g., accessURL for a registry) may be required 
	depending on resType.  See the registry session in the operator's guide.
