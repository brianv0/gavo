	is always called UPLOAD (there can thus only be one such parameter,
	but it can be present multiple times if necessary, except we've
	not figured out how to do the description right in that case).

	It contains a comma-separated pair of (key,source) pairs, where
	source is a URL; there's a special scheme param: for referring to 
	inline uploads by their name.

	This is used exclusively for metadata generation, and there's special
	code to handle it there.  There's also special code in 
	inputdef.ContextGrammar to magcially make UPLOAD into the file 
	parameters we use within DaCHS.  Sigh.
