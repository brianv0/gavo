	Job parameters are (normally) elements of a job's parameters dictionary,
	i.e., usually elements of the job control language.  "Magic" parameters
	that allow automatic serialization or special effects on the job
	can be defined using the _parameter_name class attributes of
	UWSJobs.  They are employed when using the setSerializedPar and
	getSerializedPar interface.

	All methods of these are class or static methods since 
	ProtocolParameters are never instanciated.

	The default value setter enforces a maximum length of 50000 characters
	for incoming strings.  This is a mild shield against accidental DoS
	with, e.g., bad uploads in TAP.

	The serialization thing really belongs to the user-facing interface.
	However, since it's most convenient to have these parameters
	in the UWSJob classes, the class is defined here.

	Internal clients would read the parameters directly from the dictionary.

	Methods you can override:

		- addPar(value, job) -> None -- parse value and perform some action
			(typically, set an attribute) on job.  The default implementation
			puts value into the parameters dictionary _deserialized.
		- getPar(job) -> string -- infer a string representation of the
			job parameter on job.  The default implementation gets
			the value from the parameter from the parameters dictionary and
			_serializes it.
		- _deserialize(str) -> val -- turns something from an XML tree
		  into a python value as usable by the worker
		- _serialize(val) -> str -- yields some XML-embeddable serialization
		  of val

	The default implementation just dumps/gets name from the job's
	parameters dict.  This is the behaviour for non-magic parameters
	since (get|set)SerializedPar falls back to the base class.

	CAUTION: Do *not* say job.parameters[bla] = "ab" -- your changes
	will get lost because serialisation of the parameters dictioanry must
	be initiated manually.  Always manipulate the parameters dictionary
	by using cls.updatePar(name, value, job) or a suitable

	UWS jobs are always instanciated with a row from the associated
	jobs table (i.e. a dictionary giving all the uws parameters).  You
	can read the properties as attributes.  UWSJobs also keep
	a (weak) reference to the UWS that made them.

	To alter uws parameters, use the change method.  This will fail unless
	the job was created giving writable=True.

	To make it concrete, you need to define:

	- a _jobsTDid attribute giving the (cross) id of the UWS jobs
	  table for this kind of job
	- a _transitions attribute giving a UWSTransitions instance that defines
	  what to do on transistions

	- as needed, methods _decode_<parName> and _encode_<parName>
	  to bring uws parameters (i.e., everything that has a DB column)
	  from and to the DB representation from *python* values.

	You may want to override:

	- a class method getNewId(uws, writableConn) -> str, a method 
	  allocating a unique id for a new job and returning it.  Beware
	  of races here; if your allocation is through the database table,
	  you'll have to lock it *and* write a preliminary record with your new
	  id.  The default implementation does this, but if you want
	  something in the file system, you probably don't want to
	  use that.

	If have have non-string items in the job parameters dictionary, define
	class attributes _parameters_<parname.lower()> with JobParameter
	values saying how they are serialized and deserialized.  You
	do not need to do this for string parameters.
	
	If you need to clean up before the job is torn down, redefine
	the prepareForDestruction method.

# Why no properties?  Well, I could do them from the metaclass, and

# module import, and I don't want that.  So, it'd be major trickery
# and I don't think it's worth that kind of effort.
#
# Why the odd hoops with serialization and deserialization?
# Well, what's in the database is "directly" defined by the protocol.
# Thus, the protocol methods (e.g., speaking HTTP) will know about the
# external representations, and UWSJobs just return python values for them.
#
# For job parameters, the serialization is something about the job control

	A UWSTransitions instance is in the transitions attribute of a job

	The main interface to UWSTransitions is getTransition(p1, p2) -> callable
	It returns a callable that should push the automaton from phase p1
	to phase p2 or raise an ValidationError for a field phase.

	The callable has the signature f(desiredPhase, wjob, input) -> None.
	It must alter the uwsJob object as appropriate.  input is some object
	defined by the the transition.  The job passed is a changeable job,
	so the handlers actually hold locks to the job row.  Thus, be brief.

	The transitions are implemented as simple methods having the signature
	of the callables returned by getTransition.  
	
	To link transistions and methods, pass a vertices list to the constructor.
	This list consists of 3-tuples of strings (from, to, method-name).  From and
