"""
Helpers for manipulating FITS files.

In contrast to fitstools, this is not for online processing or import of
files, but just for the manipulation before processing.

Rough guideline: if it's about writing fixed fits files, it probably belongs
here, otherwise it goes to fitstools.

Realistically, this module has been hemorraghing functions to
fitstools and probably should be removed completely.
