This directory contains support code for the querulator, a mechanism
to quickly generate canned queries.  Basically, you embed something like

<?query SELECT
	{{date_obs|Observation date|date}}, 
	{{object|Target object|date}}, 
	{{filename|File name|string}},
	{{datapath|Image|url}}
FROM maidanak.rawframes WHERE 
{{Object observed|object=choiceFromDb("select distinct object from maidanak.rawframes")}} AND
{{Observation after|date>date()}}  AND
{{Observation before|date<date()}} ?>

into a html page and get automated forms and automated querying of a
database.
