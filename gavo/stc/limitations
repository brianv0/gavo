(1) Multiple intervals (i.e., with more than two coordinates) can be parsed from
STC-S but cannot be serialized back into STC-S.  The current syntax is
somewhat inconsistent with the rest of STC-S, and I expect it to be
changed in one way or another.

(2) The Redshift sub-phrase wants the redshift value in front of the redshift
type.  I consider that a typo.  The implementation allows type and dopplerdef
behind the value (which would overwrite previous definitions) but generates
them in front of the value.
