	Resource mixins are resource descriptor fragments typically rooted
	in tables (though it's conceivable that other structures could
	grow mixin attributes as well).

	They are used to define and implement certain behaviours components of
	the DC software want to see:

	- products want to be added into their table, and certain fields are required
		within tables describing products
	- tables containing positions need some basic machinery to support scs.
	- siap needs quite a bunch of fields

	Mixins consist of events that are played back on the structure
	mixing in before anything else happens (much like original) and
	two procedure definitions, viz, processEarly and processLate.
	These can access the structure that has the mixin as substrate.

	processEarly is called as part of the substrate's completeElement
	method.  processLate is executed just before the parser exits.  This
	is the place to fix up anything that uses the table mixed in.  Note,
	however, that you should be as conservative as possible here -- you
	should think of DC structures as immutable as long as possible.

	Programmatically, you can check if a certain table mixes in 
	something by calling its mixesIn method.

	Recursive application of mixins, even to seperate objects, will deadlock.
