	no longer works). The stuff is run in a thread, and exceptions caught.  If

	Note that, in contrast to cron, I/O is not captured (that would
	be difficult for threads; we don't want processes because of
	the potential trouble with database connections).

	There's a module-private instance of this that's used by Execute.

	execution and also raise a ReportableError in that case.

	In the frequent use case of a resdir-relative python program, you
	can use the execDef.spawnPython(modulePath) function.

	If you must stay within the server process, you can do something like::

		mod = utils.loadPythonModule(rd.getAbsPath("bin/coverageplot.py"))
		mod.makePlot()

	code should never run twice at the same time.

	At least on CPython, you must make sure your code does not
	block with the GIL held; this is still in the server process.
	If you do daring things, fork off (note that you must not use
