	to be singletons;  CachedGetters should be used where the
	construction of a resource (e.g., a grammar) should be deferred
	until it is actually needed to save on startup times.

	The resource is created on the first call, all further calls
	just return references to the original object.

	You can also leave out the getter argument and add an argumentless
	method impl computing the value to cache.

	Using a CachedGetter also serializes generation, so you can also
	use it when getter isn't thread-safe.

	At construction, you can pass a f(thing) -> bool in an isAlive
	keyword argument.  If you do, the function will be called with the
	cache before the cache is being returned.  If it returns false,
	the resource is re-made (no concurrency control is enforced here).

		- getIdFor(object) -- returns an id for object if makeIdFor has already
			been called before.  Otherwise, a NotFoundError is raised

		- getOrMakeIdFor(object) -- returns an id for object; if object has
			been seen before, it's the same id as before.  Identity is by equality
			for purposes of dictionaries.

		- getForId(id) -- returns the object belonging to an id that has
			been handed out before.  Raises a NotFoundError for unknown ids.

		- cloneFrom(other) -- overwrites the self's id management dictionaries 
			with those from other.  You want this if two id managers must work
