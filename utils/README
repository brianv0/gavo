This directory contains some scripts used outside of the gavo library 
proper that we believe are a bit more than ephemeral hacks (but usually
not much more either:-)

They should contain their location in a "structured" comment in the head
-- maybe at some point I'll do some automated deployment/retrieval
of these things.  This should look like this:

# ** ARI-Location: alnilam:/data/gavo/inputs/rauchspectra/bin/uploadspec.py
