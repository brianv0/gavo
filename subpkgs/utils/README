Helper modules for GAVO data center code.

The modules here are a wild mixture of functions and classes useful
to some part of the data center.  There probably is little independent
use for them, at least not in this combination.

For explanations, documentation, etc. refer to the complete DaCHS source
tree, avaliable from http://vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/soft.
