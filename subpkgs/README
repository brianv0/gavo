A machinery for generating (namespace-) subpackages.   Read and edit 
subsetup.py to include new subpackages.

It would have been nice to let these things be built as namespace
packages, but there seem to be bugs in building debian packages out
of those as of lenny.  So, ship gavo/__init__.py in gavoutils and
let everything else depend on it.
