==============================================================
Generic installation instructions for GAVO python subpackages.
==============================================================

This package is based on setuptools.

For a global installation, say::

	sudo python setup.py install

or similar.

Using setuptools for a direct installation should only be an emergency
solution.  

Signed packages for debian stable in an apt repository are available.
See 
http://vo.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/docs/DaCHS/install.html#adding-the-gavo-repository


For a private installation, we recommend using a "virtual python".  See
http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall#creating-a-virtual-python
for details.  Alternatively, follow these steps (bash shell)::

  cd    # go to your home
  mkdir vpython   # make a root for your private python installation
  # get a nifty script that sets your private python up
  wget http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/virtual-python.py
  # run the thing 
  python virtual-python.py --prefix=~/vpython
  # fix the path -- you may want to add this to your startup scripts
  # later
  export PATH=~/vpython/bin:$PATH
  cd gavoutils-0.3  # or the your source directory is called
  python setup.py install

The setup script may download some components of EasyInstall.  This is
normal.
