In here is the gavo python module, containing functions and classes to deal
with archives of astronomical data.

Notes
=====

If you really need HTM (Hierarchical Triangular Mesh) support, there's
a quick binding to the c++ htm library available at 
http://ara.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/soft/python.  To generate a level 20
htm id using the handleEquatorialPosition macro, set supportHtm to
True in gavo/parsing/macros.py.  You'll also need to uncomment the
respective fields in resources/inputs/__common__/positionfields.template

However, we recommend using q3c for efficient cone searches. It doesn't need
any of this.  See
