<h1>The GAVO Data Center</h1>
<p>This document is the main documentation index for users of the
GAVO Data Center (GDC).</p>
<p>The GDC archives  and provides access to astromical data of all kinds
for the German astronomical community (and beyond), offering both web-based
and <a href="http://www.ivoa.net">VO</a>-enabled services.</p>

<p>It is still under heavy development, so you may experience transient
outages and quirks now and then.</p>

<p>Though most of the services should work even in text-based browsers, we
recommend a web browser with CSS and Javascript enabled to access the
web-based services.</p>

<h2>Service discovery</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://vo.uni-hd.de">index page</a> lists published 
services available through web browsers.  A "[P]" in the service 
listing means that the service is password protected, either because it is
too rough for public consumption or because the data providers want
exclusive access.  In either case, you can contact 
<a href="mailto:gavo@ari.uni-heidelberg.de">the site operators</a> to inquire
about access.</p>

<p>In addition to web-based services, the data center also
provides services accessible through IVOA standard protocols like SIAP (for
images) and SCS (supporting cone searches).  These can be located through 
a <a href="http://nvo.stsci.edu/voregistry/index.aspx">Virtual Observatory registry</a> or 
<a href="http://www.g-vo.org/www/External/Tools">common VO tools</a>.
As of March 2008, we do not yet feed our records into the VO registry.</p>

<h2>Search forms</h2>

<h3>Query Fields</h3>

<p>Services not using customized interfaces have standard query forms.  These
consist of a series of input fields that either take</p>
<ul>
<li>numeric expressions -- you can recognize those from the little "[?num. expr.]" tag 
behind them.  In addition to raw numbers, you can enter <a href="__site_path__/static/help_vizier.shtml#floats">Vizier-like numeric expressions</a> here.</li>
<li>string expressions -- these have a little "[?char expr.]" tag and
by default match using patterns, evaluating metacharacters like * or ?
much like you may know from file name patterns.  To force literal matching,
prepend your strings with ==.  <a href="__site_path__/static/help_vizier.shtml#strings">Other operators available for string expressions</a> include
caseless matching, string comparisons, or negation.</li>
<li>date expressions -- these are marked with "[?date expr.]" tags.  Dates must
be given in the ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD).  Among the more useful of the
<a href="__site_path__/static/help_vizier.shtml#dates">supported operators</a>
is the range -- you can say 2004-01-02 .. 2005-05-01 to specify a range of
dates between Jan 2nd, 2004 and May 1st, 2005.</p>
<li>Selection boxes -- these are either drop down, in which case you can only 
select one entry, or open boxes you can select more than one entry in,
usually (depending on your user interface) using control-click.</li>
<li>Others -- application-specific input fields (like, e.g., cone searches)
should come with a short explanation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Query Modifiers</h3>

<p>For most queries, you will have a "Table" query field near the bottom of the
form.  You can set sorting and limit options there.  Note that depending on the
query, selecting a column to sort on may slow down the answer dramatically.
This is because your query may match large amounts of data, and even if only
100 items are returned, potentially millions of them may have to be sorted.</p>

<p>On the other hand, results overflowing the match limit are not reproducible
without a sort option, i.e., you may get a different set of, say, 100 items for
identical query parameters two different times.  The services
warn you about this fact when they return truncated results.</p>

<p>In cases in which the default match limits do not suit you, you can override
the match limit by editing the result link (see below).  You want to substitute
your value into _DBOPTIONS_LIMIT=100.  The system has has hardcoded match limit
that you cannot override in this way, but it is unlikely that it will hurt
you.</p>

<p>You can usually select an output format.  Options here include</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML -- data is returned in your web browser.  You can select additional
columns in your output from an input field that pops down when you mouse over 
it.</li>
<li>VOTable -- data is returned in IVOA's standard data format, the VOTable.
This is XML that is almost human-readable but really intended to be consumed
by tools like <a href="http://www.star.bris.ac.uk/~mbt/topcat/">Topcat</a>.
You can select a "verbosity" specifying the fields present in the output, with
1 standing for a minimal set of information, 2 for what the service author
deemed useful for the average astronomer, and 3 for (almost) all fields
available.  Furthermore, you can choose between a "human-readable" VOTable
(select this to process your data with standard XML or text-based
tools or peruse it with the naked eye) and a binary version that you
should use for larger data sets since it is much more efficient.</li>
<li>VOPlot -- starts up IndiaVO's VOPlot utility in your browser.  This lets
you visualize the returned data without any software on your
side (besides a java-capable browser).</li>
<li>FITS -- this returns FITS tables.  The data is in the first
extension.  This contains much less information than a VOTable of the
same data and thus should only be used if your backend tools do not understand
VOTables.</li>
<li>tar -- if the service contains "products" (usually FITS files of some
kind), you can download all matching items in a tar file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next to the output format selection, there are two links.  The one labeled
"[Result link]" reflects your current query as a copyable URL.  You could use
this to send a query result to colleagues, but it is particularly useful with
the VOTable output format -- you can drag and drop that link into Topcat's
"Open" dialogue or use it together with S&eacute;bastien Derriere's <a href="http://astro.u-strasbg.fr/~derriere/PLASTIC/">PLASTIC extension for firefox</a>.</p>

<p>The star (<img src="__site_path__/static/img/bookmark.png"/>) lets you
bookmark the current form -- it is basically like the result link but
doesn't actually perform the query.  This should come in handy to store
and communicate preset queries.</p>

<p>Both the result and the bookmark links require Javascript to work.</p>

<h3>The sidebar</h3>

<p>The sidebar on form and result pages contains ancillary information for the
resource the data comes from.  In the Metadata section, only metadata titles
are shown.  You can view the content by clicking on "&gt;&gt;" and hide it
again by clicking on "&lt;&lt;".</p> 

<p>The "Created" metadata item shown refers to the creation of the resource
descriptor, i.e., is related to the service rather than the data.  The "Data 
updated" item gives the date of the last "import" of a piece of the data.
Unless a service supports online modification, it can be used as an indicator
of the version of the underlying data.</p>

<h2>Your data</h2>

<p>The GAVO Data Center would be pleased to assist you in publishing your data
to the web and the VO.  If you consider putting a dataset, great or small, on
the web and want VO exposure, you are invited to talk to 
<a href="mailto:gavo@ari.uni-heidelberg.de">us</a>.</p>

<h2>Software availability</h2>

<p>The software driving the GAVO data center should eventually be available
for download.  Meanwhile, contact the administrators for SVN access.</p>
