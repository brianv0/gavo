1/LOW/2009-01-27/FIXED
	Naming in protocols/scs.py -- SCS should be consistently upper case

2/MEDIUM/2008-10-20
	StreamWriter errors cannot be propagated up yet.

3/WISHLIST/2009-01-10/FIXED
	gavoimp should have some functionality to delete everything described
	by an RD [gavodrop does this]

4/MEDIUM/2009-01-24
	Remove imageFormat column in SIAP mixin and take the data from
	product's mime.

5/MEDIUM/2009-01-27
	formalTypes for InputKeys should be computed at form construction time
	to fix the mess with required condDescs having non-required InputKeys.

6/WISHLIST/2009-01-27/FIXED
	The sidebar should become a template on disk.

7/LOW/2009-02-02
	MultiSelections are not handled correctly when used in bookmarkable forms 
	-- only the first selection is kept.

8/WISHLIST/2009-02-10
	Columns, Tables, Data Descriptors should get stripped-down base classes,
	such that an OutputTable doesn't have an adql attribute.  It simply looks
	bad in the docs.

9/LOW/2009-02-11
	Unify credentials checking in services (runAuthenticated) and products.
	Probably both should be using the Authenticate exception.

10/LOW/2009-02-11
	Turn UnicodeAttributes in grammars/kvgrammar.py to REAttributes as 
	appropriate.

11/MEDIUM/2009-02-11/FIXED
	Documentation for row triggers currently doesn't really exist.

12/MEDIUM/2009-02-11/FIXED
	Julian year functions are wrong.  Use 
	datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 12)+datetime.timedelta(days=365.25*(fracYear-2000.0) 
	(which still is not 100% precise but should really be good enough).

13/MEDIUM/2009-02-14/FIXED
	SELECT 'foo' FROM whatever raises a weird error

14/MEDIUM/2009-02-14/FIXED
	SELECT 1 as size is not parsed.

15/MEDIUM/2009-02-18
	The whole formalType/inputWidget thing with InputKeys is an absolute
	pain.  At least there should be way to suppress or override the automatic 
	vizier type conversion.

16/MEDIUM/2009-04-17/FIXED
	Conversion between from TAI to UTC computes location of leap seconds based
	on TAI rather than UTC.  This will lead to incorrect UTCs in the vicinity
	of the leap seconds.

17/MEDIUM/2009-04-20
  Pre-1972 TTs should probably be interpreted as ET and converted to GMT
	in TTtoUTC -- but they are not.
	See http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/utc/TAI-UTC_tab.html

18/LOW/2009-06-29/FIXED
	user.mkrd still contains pre-rewrite code and thus doesn't work.

19/LOW/2009-06-30
	Naming of the various data structures that deal with column properties
	in formats.votable is a complete nightmare.  The collection of column
	properties for a table needs a catchy name.

20/WISHLIST/2009-07-14
	The whole customwidget/gavo.js stuff is a mess.  Do output format, DB, etc.,
	without formal widgets.  This stuff is better done manually.  Actually
	create all necessary widgets in the result tree and scrap the dynamic
	building from gavo.js.

21/MEDIUM/2009-07-17
	Bad profiles (e.g., no database set) will cause getDBConnection to bomb
	out in an ugly way.  It should at least provide some sensible information.

22/SEVERE/2009-07-17
	The creation of metaHandler in rscdesc leads to a deadlock when 
	dc_tables does not exist yet.

23/MEDIUM/2009-07-21
	Conversion of unknown VOTable types leads to None with FromVOTableConverter.
	It should yield an exception.

24/SEVERE/2009-07-21
	A Cone Search of 180 degrees around 10,10 doesn't return the whole table
	(actually, it apparently returns nothing).

25/SEVERE/2009-07-21/FIXED
	Linefeeds embedded in queries coming from the form cause the service
	to bomb out (actually, it was only trailing whitespace)

26/MEDIUM/2009-07-30
	binarize on STC ASTs with compounds doesn't work any more.

27/WISHLIST/2009-08-04
	It would probably be helpful if instanciating an RD with a non existing
	resdir would at least issue a warning of some sort.

28/LOW/2009-08-04
	"AS" clauses should override any names obtained from system tables in ADQL.
	And we should be more careful inheriting such properties through
	functions (e.g., SQRT should probably kill almost all such properties).

29/LOW/2009-08-31
	structure.EventProcessor doesn't update root element when it has been
	Replace'd (proposed solution: Kill the abominable Replace)

30/WISHLIST/2009-09-02
	meta.ModelBasedBuilder is a horrible abomination.  Replace it with
	something that allows specification of required elements and a sane
	syntax, or, probably better, teach xmlstan the render trick of the real
	stan and write renders for meta items/meta values.

31/MEDIUM/2009-09-04
	STC information is missing in the Box mapper in valuemappers.  It's not
	always ICRS like we're claiming now.

32/MEDIUM/2009-09-08
	Form values in split-up date fields are not preserved.

33/MEDIUM/2009-10-02
	We do not actually give availability information so far.  Cores should have
	some standard way to answer availability questions, and the main system
	should be able to override what the service says.

34/LOW/2009-10-05/FIXED
	Replace RDNotFound exception with the more generic NotFoundError.

35/MEDIUM/2009-10-08
	Non-required defaulted fields (like cutout size on lswscans/positions)
	do not get their default filled in on submitted forms.

36/LOW/2009-10-16
	base.__init__ calls pyparsing...setDefaultWhitespaceChars.  It really
	shouldn't do this.  Find out what grammar needs this and do a local
	setDefaultWhitespaceChars or similar.  Then remove the setDefault... calls in
	adql.getGrammar.

37/HIGH/2009-10-19/FIXED
	ROUND and TRUNCATE should accept a second argument in ADQL.

38/MEDIUM/2009-11-03
	You can select nonsensical (on-selected) fields in the sort widget.

39/LOW/2009-11-16
	Services with verbLevel-defined outputTables are misclassified as
	TableServices if they contain positional data.  That's kinda hard
	to fix except by delaying service type determination.

40/HIGH/2009-12-11/FIXED
	select max(ntotal), min(ntotal) from usnob.platecorrs only returns one 
	column.

41/MEDIUM/2009-12-21
	When vo_managed-publishing something, try producing a resource record and
	complain if that doesn't work out.

42/MEDIUM/2010-01-25
	Try condDesc original="ref" referring to a column; this results in a
	completely unintelligble error message.

43/HIGH/2010-02-25/FIXED
	rave.main and tspectra.data have no descriptions on 
	__system__/dc_tables/list/form -- why?

44/WISHLIST/2010-04-10
	Make a "noform" renderer (or so) from the runOnEmptyInputs case of
	resourcebased.form

45/MEDIUM/2010-04-13
	Fields with formatters are not included in VOTables at all?
