	Naming in protocols/scs.py -- SCS should be consistently upper case

2/MEDIUM/2008-10-20
	StreamWriter errors cannot be propagated up yet.

3/WISHLIST/2009-01-10
	gavoimp should have some functionality to delete everything described
	by an RD

4/MEDIUM/2009-01-24
	Remove imageFormat column in SIAP mixin and take the data from
	product's mime.

5/MEDIUM/2009-01-27
	formalTypes for InputKeys should be computed at form construction time
	to fix the mess with required condDescs having non-required InputKeys.

6/WISHLIST/2009-01-27
	The sidebar should become a template on disk.

7/LOW/2009-02-02
	MultiSelections are not handled correctly when used in bookmarkable forms 
	-- only the first selection is kept.

8/WISHLIST/2009-02-10
	Columns, Tables, Data Descriptors should get stripped-down base classes,
	such that an OutputTable doesn't have an adql attribute.  It simply looks
	bad in the docs.

9/LOW/2009-02-11
	Unify credentials checking in services (runAuthenticated) and products.
	Probably both should be using the Authenticate exception.

10/LOW/2009-02-11
	Turn UnicodeAttributes in grammars/kvgrammar.py to REAttributes as 
	appropriate.

11/MEDIUM/2009-02-11/FIXED
	Documentation for row triggers currently doesn't really exist.

12/MEDIUM/2009-02-11/FIXED
	Julian year functions are wrong.  Use 
	datetime.datetime(2000, 1, 1, 12)+datetime.timedelta(days=365.25*(fracYear-2000.0) 
	(which still is not 100% precise but should really be good enough).

13/MEDIUM/2009-02-14/FIXED
	SELECT 'foo' FROM whatever raises a weird error

14/MEDIUM/2009-02-14/FIXED
	SELECT 1 as size is not parsed.

15/MEDIUM/2009-02-18
	The whole formalType/inputWidget thing with InputKeys is an absolute
	pain.  At least there should be way to suppress or override the automatic 
	vizier type conversion.

16/MEDIUM/2009-04-17/FIXED
	Conversion between from TAI to UTC computes location of leap seconds based
	on TAI rather than UTC.  This will lead to incorrect UTCs in the vicinity
	of the leap seconds.

17/MEDIUM/2009-04-20
  Pre-1972 TTs should probably be interpreted as ET and converted to GMT
	in TTtoUTC -- but they are not.
	See http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/earthor/utc/TAI-UTC_tab.html

18/LOW/2009-06-29/FIXED
	user.mkrd still contains pre-rewrite code and thus doesn't work.

19/LOW/2009-06-30
	Naming of the various data structures that deal with column properties
	in formats.votable is a complete nightmare.  The collection of column
	properties for a table needs a catchy name.

20/WISHLIST/2009-07-14
	The whole customwidget/gavo.js stuff is a mess.  Do output format, DB, etc.,
	without formal widgets.  This stuff is better done manually.  Actually
	create all necessary widgets in the result tree and scrap the dynamic
	building from gavo.js.

21/MEDIUM/2009-07-17
	Bad profiles (e.g., no database set) will cause getDBConnection to bomb
	out in an ugly way.  It should at least provide some sensible information.

22/SEVERE/2009-07-17
	The creation of metaHandler in rscdesc leads to a deadlock when 
	dc_tables does not exist yet.

23/MEDIUM/2009-07-21
	Conversion of unknown VOTable types leads to None with FromVOTableConverter.
	It should yield an exception.

24/SEVERE/2009-07-21
	A Cone Search of 180 degrees around 10,10 doesn't return the whole table
	(actually, it apparently returns nothing).

25/SEVERE/2009-07-21
	Linefeeds embedded in queries coming from the form cause the service
	to bomb out (WTF?)

26/MEDIUM/2009-07-30
	binarize on STC ASTs with compounds doesn't work any more.

27/WISHLIST/2009-08-04
	It would probably be helpful if instanciating an RD with a non existing
	resdir would at least issue a warning of some sort.

28/LOW/2009-08-04
	"AS" clauses should override any names obtained from system tables in ADQL.
	And we should be more careful inheriting such properties through
	functions (e.g., SQRT should probably kill almost all such properties).
