Note: Of course, in each version, many minor improvements and bug fixes 
go in.  To see the full history, use  

svn log http://svn.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/svn/gavo/python/trunk/ | less

to see the gory details.  If anything not mentioned here breaks something
for you, we'd consider it a severe bug, though.


Version 0.9.7 

	* Behaviour change: pythonCores no longer run in a file system sandbox 
		(can't do that thread-safely).
	* The default VOTable version delivered is now VOTable 1.3 (actually,
	  it's been 1.3 for a while now, we just didn't declare it)
	* support for Obscore 1.1 (update should be automatic)
	* support for EPN-TAP 2.0 (manually change to the #table-2.0 mixin)
	* Obscore support is now at version 1.1
	* DaCHS now supports CORS for web-based UIs
	* DaCHS's ADQL cross matches should now have "good" query plans 
	  regardless or argument order (but are half as  fast as in previous.
	  "good" cases).
	* Removed bbox-based SIAP (together with the base.Box SQL type because 
		DaCHS has been requiring pgsphere for quite a while now.


Version 0.9.6 (2016-03-16)

  * Several new indices are now created by default; you probably want them,
    too.  Run "gavo imp -I //products". Similarly, gavo imp -I <rd-id> on all
    RDs that have SSA tables with datalink services (if you don't know what
    that is, you don't have it)
  * New soda RD containing (almost) all to build a WD-compliant cube
    cutout service (and a bit more).  You can update any existing
    services you have by changing "datalink" to "soda" in the referenced
    procDefs.
  * API change: base.makeMetaItem and makeMetaValue were a pain.  They
		have simply gone in the expectation that nobody has actually used them.
		Protest if we're wrong.  Also there is no type attribute on meta
		any more.  Also, no meta/@type any more in RDs.  I hope you've not
		really used *that*.
	* API change: When CondDescs yielded more than one fragement,
	  the fragments were combined with AND so far.  Now, it's OR by
	  default (you can restore the previoius behaviour using condDesc/@joiner)
	* Some changes in the way the selection and evaluation of sort keys work
	  in particular in web interfaces.  If you've been playing games with this,
	  check if what you did still works.
	* Support for DALI 1.1 xtype="interval" parameters.
	* New recommended way to specify author lists; see
	  http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/tutorial.html#authors
	* As usual, many small bug fixes and new features.


Version 0.9.5 (2015-10-07)

	* **RD breakage**: The old DaCHS implemenation got the meaning of
		spectralSI and fluxSI completely wrong.  You will fairly certainly have
		to change RDs doing SSA.  Any occurrence of spectralSI will have to become
		spectralUnit, and fluxSI fluxUnit (run gavo val ALL to catch RDs where
		that's necessary).  While you could add correct spectralSI and fluxSI
		values (which would look like "10e-10 L" or so), the DaCHS authors
		currently consider that a waste of time.

	* Possible service breakage: We're now using VOTable tabledata parsers
	  to parse the values of PARAMs; the same code is used to parse HTTP
	  parameters.  If you define custom InputKeys and got metadata slightly
	  wrong, these services might fail now.  If you have InputKeys anywhere
	  in your RDs, make sure the corresponding services still behave as
	  expected.

	* Column naming is now ADQL-compliant, which means that leading underscores
	  are no longer considered ok for regular identifiers (though they are
	  fine to postgres).  You should run a ``gavo val ALL`` and fix any warnings
	  to the effect that something is not a "regular ADQL identifier" you may
	  get.  Also read 
	  http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/commonproblems.html#column-tab-foo-is-not-a-regular-adql-identifier
	  Since there's no harm, but it may automatically fix things, just run

	  	gavo imp -m //tap
	 	
	 	after upgrading.

	* SLAP support: If you have data on spectral lines, DaCHS now speaks
		the protocol to distribute them.

	* Generic UWS support: If you want to provide non-TAP UWS services
		(like large server-side compute jobs and such), there's now the uws.xml
		renderer (in combination with a pythonCore or customCore).
		Details at http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/ref.html#custom-uwses

	* Sidebar style has changed; actually removed the old support code, so
	  the old behaviour cannot be restored by templates and javascript alone,
	  but I'd be happy to provide you with the necessary hooks.

	* By popular demand: The "_r" column (in cone searches, distance between
		the cone center and the actual object) is there.  To get it, use
		an scsCore rather than a dbCore in your scs services.  It works with
		the form renderer, too.

	* In VO services (scs.xml, siap.xml, ssap.xml), even fields from an
	  explicit output table are now filtered by verbLevel.  This means
	  that fields you deemed unimportant might no longer show up in default
	  answers.  To get them back, either lower their verbLevel or add
	  a query parameter VERB=3.


Version 0.9.4 (2015-02-03)

  * Uniform referencing to RDs and elements in them, allowing to skip
    input-relative paths in all of gavo's subcommands.

  * Some fixes for Debian jessie compatibility.

  * fitsProdGrammar supports compressed FITSes transparently.

  * New templating system for writing more beautiful FITS headers
    in processing (see kapteyn/q in hdinputs for examples)

  * New grammar for working with CDF files

  * New api renderer for DAL-style machine-oriented services (see
    sp_ace/q in hdinputs for an example)

  * Transparent support for gzip compression on selected documents

  * We now officially force SIAP services to have their bandpasses in m
    (if this breaks your service, it's been broken before).

  * Possibly bookmark-relevant change: _DBOPTIONS_LIMIT is now MAXREC

  * Possibly scripting-relevant change: --ui option on gavo imp now
    needs to be given before the imp.

  * Possibly registry-relevant change: this upgrade will change your
    TAP service's IVORN (to ivo://<authority>/tap; we admit that was
    a dumb idea, but reverting now will only make things worse)


Version 0.9.3 (2014-09-04)

  * Improved EPN-TAP support such that it actually works (this release is
    mainly for visitors of EPSC); this includes a simple interface to
    pyPDS.

  * New "api" renderer that mimics DAL parameter style (including UPLOAD
    and metadata VOTable) but doesn't assume particular data semantics.
  
  * The registry entry for the built-in TAP service now uses the vanity
    name; if you have published your TAP service to the Registry, run 
    gavo pub //tap to have a less ugly IVORN and access URL (nothing will
    break if you don't).


Version 0.9.2 (2014-08-14)
  
  * !Important!: Internal changes to the way mixins work cause some column
    sequences to change.  In particular, as a consequence you must re-import all
    tables with non-trivial mixins.  We are really sorry about that.  Gavo
    upgrade will warn about tables it finds that need re-importing.

  * DaCHS can now produce JSON output (with certain not yet VO-standardised
    conventions) from TAP and other services.

  * TAP_SCHEMA type names are automatically updated to comply to
    recently established conventions.  If you have tricked weird type names
    into TAP_SCHEMA (you'll know if you have), please ensure DaCHS hasn't 
    messed it up.

  * DaCHS does not produce DataCollection registry records any more; they
    are all CatalogServices with (TAP) services exposing the data
    given as capabilities directly.
  
  * The generation of examples (formerly TAP examples) is now done
    completely differently.  If you have material in __system/adqlexamples,
    you'll have to move it to etc/userconfig.rd (see doc on the tap
    renderer).

  * DaCHS now has a hard dependency on python-lxml (apt-get it if on
    Debian and not running from package, otherwise see http://lxml.de/)

Version 0.9.1 (2014-04-30)

  * New regression testing framework derived from a local hack we've had
    in the GAVO DC for a while now.  Try it, it's your friend.  See the
    http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/ref.html#regression-testing

  * New framework for having operator-defined previews.  Please have a look
    at http://docs.g-vo.org/DaCHS/ref.html#product-previews for details.
    An unfortunate side effect is that all your cached previews are now 
    invalid.  Remove all files in (presumably) /var/gavo/web/previewCache.

  * Column selection for non-HTML now always includes all columns explicitely
    given in the output table (unless supressed by a displayHint).  If
    you lie about types in your output table (e.g., declare string types
    for things that are really ints), you may now get errors on VOTable
    generation.  Fix the types or have a noxml=true displayHint in these
    cases.
  
  * Removed the table attribute on ForeignKeys (that's been deprecated
    for more than a year now).  Use the inTable attribute with an
    actual table reference instead.
  
  * Datalink support bumped to WD-2014-02-28


Version 0.9 (2013-12-13)

  * API CHANGE: If you have custom logic (i.e., phraseMakers) on
    string inputKeys with values, you'll now get back lists of strings
    by default.  This will break your phraseMakers in that situation.
    Solution: Add multiplicity="single" to the inputKeys.

  * Change to latest VOUnit version.  Many unit strings that previously
    appeared ok no longer are; in particular, exponentiation is now
    ** exclusively and no longer ^.  You'll get warnings with gavo val.

  * Added support for Datalink for both cutout-like jobs and as a 
    replacement for the tentative getData proposal.  See the reference
    documentation for how to migrate from getData to Datalink.

  * No longer using sesame's SOAP interface (that's been shut down by now)

  * gavo mkboost now takes the id of the directGrammar rather than a
    pair of rd id and and table id.  It can now also parse from fits
    binary tables directly.

  * Datalink prototype changed during development: the parameter is now
    called ID in conformance with the WD; what was pubdid in the datalink
    functions is now called pubDID; several other changes that only
    concern you if you're running datalink (chances are you're not)

  * Any resource using \standardPubDID or similar needs to be re-imported.
    As that stuff hasn't been there in the last release, this probably
    doesn't concern you either.

Version 0.8.9 (2013-07-13)

  * We now officially require postgres >9.0.  If this hurts you, tell
    us, this is mainly a convenience matter.

  * DaCHS now supports the new BINARY2 VOTable encoding

  * Internal rework of web-facing parameter processing.  If you use
    custom condDescs, test those services throughly (though we've
    tried to maintain backwards compatibility)

  * TAP examples are now DALI compliant

  * There's now a facility to add custom columns to the ObsCore table.

  * SIAP processing rework.  If you have SIAP services, you should probably
     re-import them, since the old SIAP processing sometimes was a bit
     too lenient.

   * SIAP and SCS now count as "PQL" renderers, as SSAP before.  This
     means custom parameters created via buildFrom will allow range and list
     syntaxes as for SSAP.

   * Many minor updates, fixes, and compatibility improvements.

   * New root-tree.html template that you can optionally use as the
     root page; it provides some ajaxy alternative to the old root page.

Version 0.8.4 (2012-12-17)

  * New gavo upgrade command -- run this after every svn update or other
    upgrade (Debian packages to that automatically), and you should not
    have to worry about schema changes.

  * SIAP and SSAP dateObs columns are now MJD.  Unless you have custom
    web interfaces or feed the tables by some other means than the
    setMeta proc applys, you should not notice (after a gavo upgrade).
    If your SIAP/SSAP tables are part of any views except ivoa.obscore,
    drop those views before running gavo upgrade, and check those services 
    after upgrading, anyway.


Version 0.8 (2012-08-15)

  * The schema for the DaCHS-internal metadata tables changed.  To adapt
    your database, run

      gavo imp --system //dc_tables

    (to fill the tables again, say gavo pub -ma, but you'll do so in the
    next step anyway)

  * There's now a table tap_schema.groups.  To create it, say:

      gavo imp //tap createSchema 

    Do not give --system here unless you already have the tap_schema.groups
    table; if you do give --system, the existing tables will be re-created and
    you will have to say gavo pub -ma to re-fill them.

  * The schema of the service list has changed again, and the changes
    require a republication of all services.  After the update, run

      gavo imp --system //services
      gavo pub -ma

   * Some ADQL user-defined functions are now implemented as Postgres
    stored procedures.  Say::

      gavo imp //adql

    define those.

  * The UWS code now writes to the UWS tables with less privileges.
    To let it do that, you must update the privileges on all queue tables;
    in standard DaCHS, that's only the TAP table, so simply say:
    
      gavo imp -m //tap createJobTable

  * The organization running the dc is now configurable.  If you are
    running the registry interface, you must now give authority.managingOrg,
    organization.title, organization.description, and 
    organization.referenceURL in defaultmeta.txt.
    authority.managingOrg usually is ivo://<your authority>/org.

  * The former readRoles and allRoles attribute of table and resource
    elements are now called readProfiles and allProfiles and contain
    profile names rather than DB roles.  In the unlikely case you're
    using this feature, you'd have to change the RDs.

  * You can no longer map db profile "roles" to actual profile names in
    the gavorc [profiles] section.  If you actually need this, try
    symbolic links to the profile files.


Version 0.7 (2012-01-12)

  * Automatic dependency management for published resources (register and
    adql).  You must run 
    
      gavo imp --system //services upgrade_0.6.3_0.7

   after the update.

  * UWS job representation in the database changed.  You must remove all
    UWS jobs before upgrading.  After upgrading, run

      gavo imp //uws upgrade_0.6.3_0.7
      gavo imp --system //tap createJobTable

    You can ignore error messages during the first of those commands.
