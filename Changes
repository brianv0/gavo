Version 0.7.1 (2012-XX-XX)

  * The format of the service list has changed again, and the changes
    require a republication of all services.  After the update, run

      gavo imp --system //services
      gavo pub -a
  
  * The organization running the dc is now configurable.  If you are
    runnin the registry interface, you must now give authority.managingOrg,
    organization.title, organization.description, and 
    organization.referenceURL in defaultmeta.txt.
    authority.managingOrg usually is ivo://<your authority>/org.

  * The former readRoles and allRoles attribute of table and resource
    elements are now called readProfiles and allProfiles and contain
    profile names rather than DB roles.  In the unlikely case you're
    using this feature, you'd have to change the RDs.

  * There's now a table tap_schema.groups.  To create it, say:

      gavo imp //tap createSchema 

    Do not give --system here; if you do, the existing tables will be
    re-created and you will have to say gavo pub -ma to re-fill them.


Version 0.7 (2012-01-12)

  * Automatic dependency management for published resources (register and
    adql).  You must run 
    
      gavo imp --system //services upgrade_0.6.3_0.7

   after the update.

  * UWS job representation in the database changed.  You must remove all
    UWS jobs before upgrading.  After upgrading, run

      gavo imp //uws upgrade_0.6.3_0.7
      gavo imp --system //tap createJobTable

    You can ignore error messages during the first of those commands.
